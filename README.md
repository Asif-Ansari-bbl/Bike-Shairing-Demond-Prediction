# Bike-Shairing-Demond-Prediction

## Project Summery
Bike sharing systems are a means that renting bicycles in which there is a process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automaticly via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. 

Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
Several bike/scooter rides sharing facilities (e.g., Bird, Capital Bikeshare, Citi Bike) have started up lately especially in metropolitan cities like San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and one of the most important problem from a business point of view is to predict the bike demand on any particular day.

While having excess bikes results in wastage of resource (both with respect to bike maintenance and the land/bike stand required for parking and security), having fewer bikes leads to revenue loss (ranging from a short term loss due to missing out on immediate customers to potential longer term loss due to loss in future customer base), Thus, having an estimate on the demands would enable efficient functioning of these companies.

The goal of this project is to combine the historical bike usage patterns with the weather data to forecast bike rental demand. The data set consists of hourly rental data spanning two years. The training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month.

To build a machine learning model on this data, we first gathered and clean the data, and handled the null values, then we performed indepth EDA with visuals and we gathered many insights from our EDA. Then further on, we did data preprocessing.

Then we split it into training and testing sets. Next, we choose a machine learning algorithm and use the training data to train the model. Finally, you we evaluated the model's performance on the testing data to see how well it is able to predict sales.

There are many different machine learning algorithms that we used for this task, including Linear Regression, Decision trees, Random Forests, Light GBM and XGBOOST. It is also possible to use more advanced techniques, such as deep learning, to build a model on Bike Shairing Demond Prediction data.

Overall, while building a machine learning model on Bike Shairing Demond Prediction data we applied combination of data processing, machine learning techniques, and model evaluation skills. It was a challenging task, but with the right approach, we were able to create a model that can accurately predict sales for a retail store chain, and Random Forest Regression gave the best accuracy as compared to other 4 models that we trained.
